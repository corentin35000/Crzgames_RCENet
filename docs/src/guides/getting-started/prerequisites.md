# üìã Prerequisites

Welcome to the setup guide for the RC2D Framework. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up your development environment across various platforms.

## üöÄ Setup Project

### Create a new GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub to create a new repository: [Create New Repository](https://github.com/new)
2. Under 'Repository Template', select: `corentin35000/Crzgames_RC2DFramework`
3. Check : `Include all branches`
4. Choose a name for your GitHub repository.
5. Click the button to create the repository.

<br />

### Clone the Project

To start working with the game template, clone the project repository and initialize all submodules using the following commands:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:corentin35000/your_project_name.git
```

Ensure to replace `your_project_name` with the actual name of your project repository.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Make sure you do a recursive clone! The submodules contain the dependencies, if you have already cloned the project without the submodules, use this command
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
